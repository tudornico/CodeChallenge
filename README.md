# CodeChallenge
An application created for generating passwords base by user ID and Date time .

I have used the library OtpNet for the creation of the password because of the nature that it can be verified by timestamp.

The implmentation is split into 2 classes the User class which will be used for further implementation( rather said can be used for further implementation),
and the generator class where we create the implementation for password generation and validation these methods will be used in the user class.
